Record working hours easily.
------------------------------------------------------
Start a work session, pause (p), restart (r/s), and end it (e) whenever. Records are written automatically into Google Sheets.

Todos:
- [ ] Finish formatting (leading 0s)
- [ ] Finish beautifying & cleaning code
- [ ] Look for cooler/better ways to do standard things with dates & times
- [ ] How accurate are the cumulative values? (Error propagation, rounding...)
