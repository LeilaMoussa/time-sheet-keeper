Record working hours easily.
------------------------------------------------------
Start a work session, pause (p), restart (r/s), and end it (e) whenever. Records are written automatically into Google Sheets.

Todos:
- [ ] Beautify code, abstract things away
- [ ] Handle midnight signal/interrupt
- [ ] Ending routine in case of midnight
- [ ] Decorator for ending routine?
- [ ] Handle starting around midnight
- [ ] Look for cooler/better ways to do standard things with dates & times
