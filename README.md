Record working hours easily.
------------------------------------------------------
Start a work session, pause (p), restart (r/s), and end it (e) whenever. Records are written automatically into Google Sheets.

Todos:
- [ ] Finish formatting (leading 0s)
- [ ] Finish beautifying & cleaning code
- [ ] Create & handle midnight signal/interrupt, if needed
- [ ] Finish ending routine in case of midnight, if needed
- [ ] Decorator for ending routine?
- [ ] Handle starting around midnight, if needed
- [ ] Look for cooler/better ways to do standard things with dates & times
- [ ] How accurate are the cumulative values? (Error propagation, rounding...)
- [ ] Test timedelta with midnight
